            <h2 id="project-overview">I. Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project focuses on predicting housing prices using the California Housing Prices dataset. The goal
                is to build and refine a Random Forest Regressor model to accurately predict housing prices based on
                various features. The project involves data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and model
                refinement.
            </p>

            <h2 id="problem-domain">Problem Domain</h2>
            <p>
                The problem of predicting housing prices falls within the domain of real estate economics, a field that
                analyzes various factors influencing the real estate market, including housing prices. The real estate
                market is a critical component of the economy, and housing prices are influenced by a myriad of factors,
                including economic conditions, demographics, and government policies.
            </p>

            <h3>Characteristics of the Real Estate Market</h3>
            <p>
                The real estate market is unique because it is highly localized, meaning that housing prices can vary
                significantly between different regions, cities, or even neighborhoods. This variation is due to factors
                such as local economic conditions, infrastructure development, and the availability of amenities.
                Additionally, the real estate market is influenced by supply and demand dynamics, where the availability
                of housing and the level of demand for homes play crucial roles in determining prices.
            </p>

            <h3>Challenges in the Real Estate Market</h3>
            <p>
                One of the key challenges in this domain is the accurate prediction of housing prices. Given the
                complexity and variability of factors affecting the market, predicting housing prices requires a deep
                understanding of the interactions between these factors. Moreover, external events such as economic
                downturns or changes in government policies can have sudden and significant impacts on the market,
                making prediction even more challenging.
            </p>

            <h3>Unique Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                When analyzing housing prices, it is important to consider factors such as geographical location, median
                income, and housing characteristics, which can vary widely across different areas. The California
                Housing Prices dataset used in this project provides a snapshot of these factors, allowing for an
                in-depth analysis of the variables that most strongly influence housing prices in California.
                Understanding these unique considerations is crucial for developing a predictive model that is both
                accurate and reliable.
            </p>

            <h2>Project Definition</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of this project is to predict housing prices in California using the California Housing Prices
                dataset. The problem is framed as a regression task where the target variable is the median house value
                in various districts across California.
            </p>

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>
                Predicting housing prices accurately is crucial for various stakeholders, including homebuyers, real
                estate investors, and policymakers. The challenge lies in understanding how different factors, such as
                geographical location, median income, and housing characteristics, influence housing prices. By
                developing a predictive model, we can estimate housing prices based on these features, thereby providing
                valuable insights for decision-making.
            </p>

            <h3>Strategy for Solving the Problem</h3>
            <p>
                To address this problem, the project will employ a systematic approach consisting of several key steps:
            </p>
            <ol>

                            Objective: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error
                            (RMSE) and R² Score.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Model Refinement:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

            <h3>Expected Solution</h3>
            <p>
                The expected outcome of this project is a robust predictive model that accurately estimates housing
                prices based on the input features. The model's performance will be validated against a test dataset,

            <h2 id="data-visualization">III. Data Visualization</h2>
            <p>
                Data visualizations are created to convey information from the data exploration process, helping to
                understand relationships between features and identify patterns.
            </p>

            <h3>Scatter Plots</h3>
            <p>
                Scatter plots are used to show relationships between variables such as median income and median house
                value.

            <h3 id="data-preprocessing">1. Data Preprocessing</h3>
            <p>
                Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing
                numerical features to prepare the data for model building.
            </p>

            <h4>1.1 Handling Missing Values</h4>
            <p>
                We checked for missing values and handled them using appropriate methods to ensure the dataset's
                integrity.

            <p>
                Categorical variables were encoded into numeric values using one-hot encoding, making them suitable for
                machine learning models.

            <h4>1.3 Normalizing Numerical Features</h4>
            <p>
                Numerical features were normalized to ensure they are on a similar scale, which helps improve the
                performance of many machine learning algorithms.

                We implemented and evaluated a Random Forest Regressor model to predict housing prices. This involved
                selecting the model, training it, and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics.

            <h2 id="conclusion">V. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The project involved developing and refining a Random Forest Regressor to predict housing prices. The
                initial model showed excellent performance, and after applying Randomized Search for hyperparameter
                tuning, the performance was slightly improved, maintaining high accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Reflection:</strong> The Randomized Search did not significantly alter the performance metrics,
                suggesting that the default parameters were well-suited for this dataset. The hyperparameter tuning
                affirmed that the model's predictive capabilities remained robust across different parameter settings.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Future Work:</strong> Further enhancements could include exploring additional hyperparameter
                tuning techniques, investigating feature engineering opportunities, or assessing alternative algorithms.
            </p>
